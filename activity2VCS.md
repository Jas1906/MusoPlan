# VCS

### GitHub

GitHub is a popular version control system (VCS) and code hosting platform that offers several benefits compared to other version control systems. Here are some of the key advantages of using GitHub:

1. Collaboration and Social Coding: 
GitHub facilitates collaboration among developers by providing a platform for sharing and contributing to projects.
Social features such as pull requests, issues, and comments make it easy for developers to communicate and work together.

2. Distributed Version Control: 
GitHub is built on top of Git, a distributed version control system. This allows developers to work on their local copies of a repository and merge changes seamlessly.

3. Branching and Merging: 
GitHub provides robust support for branching and merging, making it easy for developers to work on different features or bug fixes in parallel and then merge their changes back into the main codebase.

4. Code Review: 
Pull requests on GitHub enable a structured code review process. Team members can review proposed changes, add comments, and discuss improvements before merging.

5. Issue Tracking:
GitHub's issue tracking system helps teams manage and prioritize tasks, bugs, and enhancements. It provides a centralized location for discussing and tracking the progress of various issues.

6. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) Integration: 
GitHub integrates with popular CI/CD tools, allowing developers to automate the testing and deployment processes. This helps ensure the stability and reliability of the codebase.

7. Community and Open Source:
GitHub is widely used for hosting open-source projects, making it easy for developers to contribute to projects beyond their own teams or organizations. The platform fosters a sense of community and collaboration.

8. Documentation and Wikis:
GitHub provides built-in support for documentation and wikis, making it easy to create and maintain project documentation alongside the code.

9. Security Features:
GitHub offers security features such as vulnerability scanning, dependency tracking, and alerts to help teams identify and address potential security issues in their code.

10. Integrations and APIs:
GitHub integrates with a wide range of third-party tools and services, making it easy to connect your development workflow with other tools your team uses.

### GitLab

GitLab is another popular version control system (VCS) and code hosting platform that offers several benefits. Here are some advantages of using GitLab compared to other version control systems:

1. Integrated DevOps Platform:
GitLab is not just a version control system; it provides a comprehensive DevOps platform that includes features for source code management, continuous integration, continuous deployment, monitoring, and more. This integrated approach can streamline the development lifecycle.

2. Built-in CI/CD:
GitLab comes with built-in Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) capabilities. This allows developers to automate testing and deployment processes directly within the GitLab platform, reducing the need for external CI/CD tools.

3. Scalability:
GitLab is designed to scale with the needs of development teams, from small projects to large enterprise-level applications. It provides features like high availability and clustering to ensure performance and reliability as projects grow.

4. Container Registry:
GitLab includes a container registry that allows teams to store and manage Docker images. This integration supports containerization and facilitates the use of container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

5. Built-in Code Review and Collaboration:
GitLab includes features for code review, collaboration, and discussion similar to those found in GitHub. Merge requests and code review workflows are integrated directly into the platform.

6. Repository Management:
GitLab provides a user-friendly interface for managing repositories, branches, and tags. It supports Git repositories and also has features for managing other types of repositories (e.g., Mercurial).

7. Built-in Issue Tracking:
GitLab includes an issue tracking system that allows teams to manage and prioritize tasks, bugs, and other work items. The issue tracker is tightly integrated with the codebase, facilitating collaboration between development and project management.

8. GitLab Pages:
GitLab Pages enables teams to easily create and host static websites directly from their GitLab repositories. This can be useful for documentation or project websites.

9. Security Features:
GitLab includes built-in security features, such as static code analysis, container scanning, and dependency scanning, to help identify and address security vulnerabilities in the codebase.

10. Flexible Deployment Options:
GitLab can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud. This flexibility allows teams to choose the deployment option that best fits their security and infrastructure requirements.

### BitBucket

Bitbucket, like GitHub and GitLab, is a web-based platform for version control using Git or Mercurial. Here are some benefits of using Bitbucket as a version control system (VCS) compared to other software:

1. Integration with Jira:
Bitbucket is closely integrated with Jira, a popular project management and issue tracking tool. This integration allows for seamless collaboration between development and project management teams.

2. Unified Platform for Teams:
Bitbucket provides a unified platform for source code management, collaboration, and CI/CD. It includes features for code review, pull requests, and pipelines, offering a comprehensive solution for development teams.

3. Branching and Merging:
Bitbucket supports robust branching and merging capabilities, allowing teams to work on parallel features and merge changes with confidence. The platform supports both Git and Mercurial repositories.

4. Flexible Deployment Models:
Bitbucket offers both cloud-based and on-premises deployment options, providing flexibility for teams with different infrastructure and security requirements.

5. Code Review and Collaboration:
Bitbucket includes features for code review, pull requests, and discussions, fostering collaboration among team members. The code review process can be customized to fit the team's workflow

6. Built-in CI/CD:
Bitbucket Pipelines provides built-in CI/CD capabilities, allowing teams to automate the testing and deployment processes directly within Bitbucket. This helps maintain code quality and streamline the development workflow.

7. Security and Access Controls:
Bitbucket provides robust security features, including access controls, branch permissions, and integration with identity management systems. Teams can control who has access to repositories and enforce security policies.

8. Smart Mirroring:
Bitbucket offers smart mirroring for distributed teams. This feature allows teams to set up mirrors in different geographic locations, improving performance for users in remote locations.

9. Bitbucket Data Center:
Bitbucket Data Center is an enterprise-grade solution that offers high availability, scalability, and performance for large organizations with extensive version control needs. It is designed to meet the demands of large-scale enterprise deployments.


10. Bitbucket Marketplace:
The Bitbucket Marketplace provides a variety of plugins and integrations that extend the functionality of Bitbucket. Teams can customize their Bitbucket instance by adding plugins that suit their specific needs.

### Why use GitHub?

We decide to go with github because it fits our goal for our software project. most of the benefits listed fits our organisational requirement. Things such as branchiung and merging, Security Features, Collaboration and Social Coding, issue tracking fits our requirement.

### Installing GitHub

- First of all we are using gitbash for our terminal so we need to download and install it
- once downloaded open gitbash and type "git version" to make sure it is installed properly
- next is to configure it to have author name and email
- we have to sign up on github with email address
- once signed up we configure on our gitbash terminal with "git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"" and "git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com""
- and installation should be done

installing Git was easy and straight foward and we did not encountered any issue.
